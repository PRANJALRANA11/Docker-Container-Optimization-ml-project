## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository
If you haven't already, fork the project's repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes.

### Set Up Your Development Environment
Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Install the necessary dependencies, and follow the project's specific instructions for setting up your development environment. Be sure to work in a new branch for your changes.

## Contributing

### Creating an Issue
Before working on a new feature or bug fix, it's recommended to create an issue to discuss it with the maintainers and the community. This helps ensure your idea aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplicating efforts.

### Making Changes
1. Ensure you are working in a dedicated branch.
2. Write clean, maintainable code.
3. Include appropriate tests for your changes.
4. Keep commits small, focused, and use clear commit messages (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)).

### Commit Messages
Good commit messages help keep the project's history readable and meaningful. Please follow these guidelines:
- Use concise, descriptive messages.
- Start with a capital letter and use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Provide context and reference issue numbers if applicable.

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main branch.
2. Open a pull request (PR) to the project's main repository.
3. Provide a clear title and description of your changes in the PR.
4. Reference the issue(s) your PR addresses.
5. Be prepared to make adjustments based on feedback from reviewers.

## Review Process
Maintainers and community members will review your PR. They may request changes or provide feedback. Be responsive to these comments and update your PR accordingly.

## Code of Conduct
Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand the expected behavior and responsibilities within our community.
